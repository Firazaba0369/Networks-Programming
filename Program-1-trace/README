Name: Francisco Irazaba Lab Time: 3â€“6 PM

Files Included in Submission:

trace.c: The main implementation file for the trace program. It contains logic for parsing and printing information about Ethernet, IP, ARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers from a given .pcap file.

trace.h: Header file containing macros, structs, and function prototypes used in trace.c.

checksum.c and checksum.h: Contain the Internet checksum functions used for validating IP and TCP headers.

Makefile: Builds the program on the CSL Unix machines without warnings. The output executable can be run by providing a .pcap file as an argument.

README: This file.

Description: This program analyzes a .pcap file and extracts protocol headers including Ethernet, IP, ARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP. It prints formatted, human-readable information about each packet's contents, including checksums and protocol-specific details. This tool is useful for debugging and understanding packet-level network traffic.

How to Compile: Run make in the directory containing the source files. The compiled program will be named trace.

How to Run:

./trace <your_file.pcap>
