Lab Time: 3â€“6 PM  

Files Included in Submission:

rcopy.c: Client-side (UDP) implementation. Reads user input, constructs PDUs using `createPDU()`, prints them with `printPDU()`, and sends them to the server using `sendtoErr()`.

server.c: Server-side (UDP) implementation. Receives PDUs via `recvfrom()`, prints them using `printPDU()`, and echoes the PDU back to the client using `sendtoErr()`.

winbuf.c and winbuf.h: Sliding window and buffer implementation used by client and server. Handles out-of-order packets, retransmission tracking, and orderly delivery.

pdu.c and pdu.h: Implements `createPDU()` and `printPDU()` functions for building and inspecting PDUs with sequence number, checksum, flag, and payload.

safeUtil.c and safeUtil.h: Utility functions, including `safeSendto()` which has been modified to use `sendtoErr()` instead of `sendto()`.

networks.c and networks.h: Provided network utility code for setting up sockets and parsing hostnames.

pollLib.c and pollLib.h: Provided helper functions for working with the `poll()` system call (not heavily used in this lab, but included for future reference).

gethostbyname.c and gethostbyname.h: Provided DNS resolution helpers.

Makefile: Compiles the client and server executables (`rcopy` and `server`) and links against the `sendtoErr` library (`libcpe464.a.b.a`).

README: This file.

How to Compile:  
Run `make` in the directory containing the source files. This will produce two executables: `rcopy` and `server`.

How to Run:

Server Terminal:
    ./server error-rate port-number

    Example:
    ./server 0.05 44444

Client Terminal:
    ./rcopy from-filename to-filename window-size buffer-size error-rate remote-machine remote-port

    Example:
    ./rcopy from_file to_file 10 1000 0.1 localhost 44444
